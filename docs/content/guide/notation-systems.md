+++

A core idea in Keyflow: the same music can be written three ways, and they're
**fully interchangeable**. Everything after the root — quality, sevenths,
extensions, alterations, slash bass (see [Chords](/guide/chords/)) — works
identically in all three. You only choose how to spell the *root*.

| System | Same four bars | Reads as |
| ------ | -------------- | -------- |
| **Letter names** | `C  F  Am  G` | absolute pitches |
| **Nashville numbers** | `1  4  6m  5` | scale degrees in the key |
| **Roman numerals** | `I  IV  vi  V` | scale degrees in the key |

Use whichever fits the chart — letter names for a fixed-key lead sheet, numbers
for a transposable worship/Nashville chart, Roman numerals for analysis or
classical feel.

## Letter names

Absolute pitch. The root is a note `A`–`G` with an optional accidental, and the
quality is written out explicitly:

```
C    F#    Bb    Am    Cmaj7    F#m7b5
```

Letter names don't depend on the key — `C` is always C.

## Nashville numbers

The root is a **scale degree** `1`–`7`, relative to the song's key. A bare
number automatically takes the key's **diatonic quality** — you don't write the
`m`. In a major key `1 2 3 4 5 6 7` gives:

| Degree | `1` | `2` | `3` | `4` | `5` | `6` | `7` |
| ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Quality | major | minor | minor | major | major | minor | dim |
| In C | C | Dm | Em | F | G | Am | B° |

So `2` *is* the ii chord (minor) — no need to write `2m`. Minor keys get their
own diatonic qualities (in A minor, `1` is Am, `2` is B°). Sevenths and
extensions stack on the implied triad: `2:7` is ii m7 (Dm7), `5:7` is V7 (G7).

And because the chart stores degrees, the same `1 4 5` is C–F–G in C and G–C–D
in G — that's the point of the number system: the progression, independent of
key.

### Overriding the quality

- **`!`** before a number is *literal* — it drops the key association, so a
  bare `!2` is a plain major triad (D in C).
- An **explicit quality** overrides the diatonic one: `2M` / `2Major` /
  `2:maj` for major, `2m` for minor, plus `2dim`, `2aug`, `2sus4`, …

So `2` = Dm (diatonic), `2M` = D (forced major), `!2` = D (literal), `2m` = Dm
(explicit).

## Roman numerals

Also a scale degree relative to the key, but **case carries the quality** —
**uppercase is major, lowercase is minor**:

```
I  ii  iii  IV  V  vi  vii      →  I, iim, iiim, IV, V, vim, viim
```

You can still add explicit descriptors on top: `Imaj7`, `V7`, `iim7`.

Roman numerals also unlock two analyst's tools, both covered on the
[Chords](/guide/chords/) page: **secondary chords** with `/` (`V/V` is "five of
five"), and **inversions** with `^` (`V^65` is a first-inversion dominant 7th).

## Readability: the `:` separator

When a number or numeral is followed by a quality that *starts with a digit*,
the two runs of digits can be hard to read — is `17` "degree 1, seventh" or the
number seventeen? Optionally put a colon between the root and the quality:

```
1:7      4:maj9      2:m7      5:9
```

It's purely for readability and carries no meaning — `1:7` and `17` parse
identically, as do `4:maj9` and `4maj9`. The colon works on **all three
systems** — numbers (`4:maj9`), Roman numerals (`V:7`, `i:m7`), and letter
names (`C:7`) — though it matters most for numbers.

**Good practice: write the `:`.** `1:7` reads cleanly; `17` is correct but
easy to misread. (A future editor will insert the `:` for you automatically.)

## Relative to the key

Both number-based systems resolve against the key set in the
[header](/guide/structure/) (`#C`, `#Gm`, …). Because the chart stores *degrees*
rather than fixed pitches, transposing a Nashville or Roman chart is just
changing the key in the header — every chord follows.

Letter names are the opposite: fixed pitches that ignore the key.

## Accidentals and borrowed chords

Put `#` (sharp) or `b` (flat) before a degree or numeral to raise or lower it —
exactly how you write a borrowed or chromatic chord:

```
1  b3  4  b7        (numbers)   ♭3 and ♭7 borrowed
I  bIII  IV  bVII   (Roman)     ♭III and ♭VII borrowed
1  #4  5            sharpened 4th
```

Since almost no one can type a real ♭ glyph, Keyflow treats the plain letter
**`b` as a flat** in these positions.

### The `b7` question

That creates one genuine ambiguity: **`b7`** could mean the *note* B with a
7th (`B7`), or the *flat-7 degree* (`♭7`). Keyflow resolves it from the
surrounding notation system:

| Context | `b7` means |
| ------- | ---------- |
| Letter-name chart (`C  F  b7  G`) | the chord **B7** |
| Number chart (`1  4  b7  5`) | the **♭7** degree |
| Roman chart (`I  IV  b7  V`) | the **♭7** degree |
| No surrounding context | the chord **B7** |

The current line decides first; if it can't tell, the rest of the chart does;
failing that it's read as the note B. Only `b5`/`b6`/`b7` are ever ambiguous —
`b9` and up can only be the note B (degrees stop at 7), and any `#`-prefixed
number is always a degree.

## Mixing systems

You can borrow a Roman or number chord inside a letter chart — `bVII` and `#IV`
are unambiguous, so `Bb  bVII  Eb` reads the `bVII` as the flat-7 degree while
the rest stay letter names.

## The same for melody

The naming carries over to melody too — melody notes are written as **letter
names or scale-degree numbers**, the same choice you make for a chord root.
(Roman numerals name chords, not single notes.) See the
[Melody](/guide/melody/) page.
